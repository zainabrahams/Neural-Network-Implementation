# 🧠 Neural Network Fashion-MNIST Classifier (Built From Scratch)

## 📌 Project Summary
This project implements a fully connected **three-layer Neural Network (MLP)** completely from scratch using **Python and NumPy**, without any machine learning frameworks (no TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, or sklearn). The model was trained to classify the **Fashion-MNIST** dataset, which contains **70,000 grayscale clothing images** across 10 categories.
