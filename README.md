# Neural-Network-Implementation
For a university project, I developed a fully connected 3-layer Neural Network (MLP) entirely from scratch. I was restricted from using deep learning libraries, so I relied solely on Python and NumPy.  I manually implemented forward and backward propagation algorithms using NumPy vectorization (np.dot) to optimize matrix multiplication
